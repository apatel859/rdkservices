# 7. CHANGELOG file

Create `CHANGELOG.md` file that is used to track changes done to this plugin. RDKServices uses semantic versioning and all changes to the plugin should include a version update and be documented in this file.

Provide user friendly information on what was changed with the new version. Please don't mention JIRA tickets in CHANGELOG.

Please Add entry in the CHANGELOG for each version change and indicate the type of change with these labels:

* **Added** for new features.
* **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.
* **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features.
* **Removed** for now removed features.
* **Fixed** for any bug fixes.
* **Security** in case of vulnerabilities.
